            <h1>About Me</h1>

            <hr>
            <p>I am 54 year old engineer by training, have worked in the energy business for all of my career thus far,
                with
                a high-tech slant. Currently I am working on computer vision for remote industrialized locations where
                24/7
                supervision is often not possible or is very expensive. The thought is that with AI and computer vision,
                many routine supervisory monitoring tasks can be automated to make work safer and more rewarding.</p>

            <p>Originally, I am from Puerto La Cruz, Venezuela, and moved every four years or so growing up, living in
                Spain, Miami, San Juan, and then finally ending up in Denver when I started High School. I went to a
                college
                in-state, but then went about travels again, moving first to South America and later to Europe before
                finally returning back to Denver in 2016. All-in-all, though, I consider myself a Western man, as I
                always
                loved reading as a child the stories of the frontier, pioneers, and the mountain men that came west. It
                is
                the DU "Pioneers," after all, isn't it?</p>
